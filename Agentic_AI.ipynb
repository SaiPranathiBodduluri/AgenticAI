Under this, \\nwe find out who the ‘Stakeholders’ to this problem are and what we know about them. Stakeholders are \\nthe people who face this problem and would be benefitted with the solution. \\nWhat?  \\nUnder the “What” block, you need to look into what you have on hand. At this stage, you need to \\ndetermine the nature of the problem. What is the problem and how do you know that it is a problem? \\nUnder this block, you also gather evidence to prove that the problem you have selected actually exists. \\nNewspaper articles, Media, announcements, etc are some examples. \\nWhere?  \\nNow that you know who is associated with the problem and what the problem actually is; you need to \\nfocus on the context/situation/location of the problem. This block will help you look into the situation in \\nwhich the problem arises, the context of it, and the locations where it is prominent. \\nWhy?  \\nYou have finally listed down all the major elements that affect the problem directly. Now it is convenient \\nto understand who the people that would be benefitted by the solution are; what is to be solved; and \\nwhere will the solution be deployed. These three canvases now become the base of why you want to \\nsolve this problem. Thus, in the “Why” canvas, think about the benefits which the stakeholders would \\nget from the solution and how it will benefit them as well as the society. \\n \\nData Acquisition  \\nData acquisition is the process of collecting and gathering data from various sources.

Interviews: Interviews involve direct communication between an interviewer and interviewee(s) to \\ncollect detailed information on a particular topic. I nterviews can be structured, semi -structured, or \\nunstructured depending on the level of formality and flexibility needed. \\n3. Observational Studies: Observational studies involve systematically observing and recording behaviors, \\nevents, or phenomena in natural  settings without intervention. This method is often used in fields like \\nanthropology, sociology, and psychology. \\n4. Experiments: Experiments involve manipulating variables under controlled conditions to observe the \\neffects on other variables. This method allows researchers to establish cause-and-effect relationships. \\n5. Data Mining : Data mining involves extracting patterns and insights from large datasets using \\ncomputational techniques such as machine learning, statistical analysis, and pattern recognition. \\n6. Web Scraping: Web scraping involves automatically extracting data from websites. This method is often \\nused to collect data from online sources such as social media, e-commerce websites, and news websites. \\n7.

Under the Learning Based approach, the \\nAI model gets trained on the data fed to it and then is able to design a model which is adaptive to the \\nchange in data. That is, if the model is trained with X type of data and the machine designs the algorithm \\naround it, the model would modify itself according to the changes which occur in the data so that all the \\nexceptions are handled in this case. \\nSupervised Learning  \\nIn a supervised learning model, the dataset which is fed to the machine is labelled. In other words, we \\ncan say that the dataset is known to the person who is tra ining the machine only then he/she is able to \\nlabel the data. A label is some information which can be used as a tag for data. For example, students \\nget grades according to the marks they secure in examinations. These grades are labels which categorise \\nthe students according to their marks. \\nThere are two types of Supervised Learning models : \\nClassification:  \\nClassification is a fundamental task in machine learning and artificial \\nintelligence where the goal is to categorize input data into one of several \\npredefined classes or categories. It's widely used across various \\ndomains, including image recognition, natural language processing, \\nmedical diagnosis, and spam filtering, among others. \\n \\n \\nRegression \\nRegression is another fundamental task in machine learning and statistical \\nmodeling, distinct from  classification.

It's comm only used for tasks such as predicting house \\nprices, stock prices, temperature, sales forecasts, and more. \\n \\nUnsupervised Learning  \\nAn unsupervised learning model works on unlabelled dataset. This means that the data which is fed to \\nthe machine is random and there is a possibility that the person who is training the model does not have \\nany information regarding it. The unsupervised learning models are used to identify relationships, \\npatterns and trends out of the data which is fed into it.

Neurons are organized into layers, \\nincluding input, hidden, and output layers. \\n \\n2. Weights and Biases: Each co nnection between neurons in adjacent layers is associated with a weight, \\nwhich determines the strength of the connection. Additionally, each neuron typically has an associated \\nbias term, which allows the network to learn more complex functions. \\n \\n3. Activation Function: The activation function of a neuron determines its output based on the weighted \\nsum of its inputs. Common activation functions include the sigmoid, tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), \\nand softmax functions. \\n \\n4. Layers: A neural network is organized  into layers, with each layer containing a group of neurons. The \\ninput layer receives the initial input data, while the output layer produces the final output of the network. \\nHidden layers, located between the input and output layers, perform intermediate computations. \\n \\n5. Feedforward and Backpropagation: In the feedforward phase, input data is passed through the network, \\nand predictions are generated. During backpropagation, the error between the predicted output and the \\ntrue output is calculated and used to update the network's weights and biases, typically using \\noptimization techniques such as gradient descent. \\n \\n6. Training Data: Neural networks are trained using labeled datasets, where each example is associated with \\na known input and output. The network learn s to approximate the mapping from inputs to outputs by \\nadjusting its parameters to minimize the prediction error on the training data. \\n \\n7. Loss Function: The loss function measures the difference between the predicted output of the neural \\nnetwork and the true  output for a given example.
